        <h1> Overview </h1>
          <p>I was tasked with determining how a design choice could impact User Interaction by running A/B testing on two different web designs. I will do this by gathering data on user interaction and analyzing the results using t-tests, an inferential statistic used to evaluate significant differences between two groups' means and their relationship.</p>
          <p>The first UI I was given and with the second one I redesigned the first one. The website was formatted for someone who intended to make a doctor's appointment and the site gives information on which days certain doctors are available at a certain place. Some of the changes I made were changing the color of buttons to make less confusion around which button was “scheduling an appointment” and which button went to the “see appointment” page. I also changed the format of the buttons and created a line between each appointment to distinguish between them all.</p>

    <div id="Data Collection" class="section">
      <h1>Data Colletion</h1>
      <p>This assignment was done in a class, and so the data I collected was from a lab we all participated in. We first all ‘tested’ the A version of the interface. We did this by being tasked with scheduling an appointment on a specific day, with a certain doctor. After we all did this, we were able to make changes to the website ended up being version B. Then, went around and tested each other's designs. It was the same people who tested version A that tested version B.

            I created hypothesis for the folllowing data points: the misclick rate, the time spent on page, and the time it took for them to first click.

                There is no difference between the two versions for the average time spent on the page.
              </td>
              <td>
                The average time to first click is going to be to be the same for both versions.

                The misclick rate of version A will be greater than version B's.

                The time spent on the page will be longer for version A users than version B.

                I predict that I will reject the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis 
                will be true because of the button spacing being too close together, 
                low contrast between colors, and appointment sections not being clearly distinguished.
              </td>
              <td>
                I predict that the null hypothesis wil be rejected because of the button spacing, 
                low contrast between colors, and appointment sections not being clearly distinguished.

                that the misclick rate will be higher for version A than version B. User's will have a harder time seeing which
                button is for a certain purpose which will lead them to click the wrong one.
              </td>
              <td>Because of the appointments having no clear distinguishment from each other and the spacing being too close between the buttons, I hypothesize
                that the time spent on the page will be longer for version A than version B. User's will have a harder time seeing which
                button is for a certain purpose and if the button is on the right line. This will lead them to take longer to see if what option 
                they are choosing is correct.
